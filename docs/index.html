								The world is a changing place. Weather patterns are shifting, sea levels are rising, and the climate is 
								getting warmer. These changes are affecting the world's forests, which are home to more than 1.6 billion
								people. Forests are vital to the health of our planet, providing clean air and water, protecting
								against floods and droughts, and providing habitat for wildlife. <b>But forests are also being lost at an alarmingly high rate.</b>

								Globally, we see a reduction in forest area, but the rate of loss varies by region. Some countries seem to contain 
								their forest cover, whilst other regions see a rapid decline. The below worldmap examines forest cover as a percentage of 
								the countries land area that is forested. The map is interactive, and allows you to hover over a country to see the percentage of forest cover.

							<h3 class="bottom-line">Forest Cover on the retreat</h3>
							<p>
								In just the last 100 years, more than 50% of the forest loss since 8,000 B.C. has occurred.
								With the forest loss, so comes the loss of indegenious ways of life and the wildlife within.
								The deeprooted ecosystems are lost or degraded, which harms any neighbouring people as well.
								We must ensure one culture's way of life doesn't threaten any others'.
								<br> Some regions seem to be offsetting the loss of tropical forest, there's just one catch - all forest is not equal.
								Offsetting tropical forest with monocultures such as palm oil or timber logging plantations may
								balance the equation on paper, <b> but the two types of forest are not fulfilling the same environmental duties. </b>
								Deep rooted ecosystems help filter water, stop landslides and are part of an intricate system that maintains
								the biodiversity and habitat of living organisms - monocultures are not. 
								<b> This offset also obscures the true extent of deforestation</b>, making it appear less critical.

								International trade handles tons of products stemming either directly from deforestation (logging) or indirectly
								through expansion of farmland or cropland into previously forested areas. 
								By tracking how the imported goods were made in the exporting country, we can follow how much each product,
								and by extension importing countries, contribute to deforestation: 
								This metric is called <b>net traded deforestation</b> and mapping it reveals that countries with stable
								forest cover have that by accord of international tropical deforestation.

						<div class="text">
							<p>
								Net traded deforestation reveals that <b> deforestation is in large part driven by developed countries</b>, as their imported
								products are sourced from the less developed countries, often tropical. 
								It is in the tropics we find the largest biodiversity which makes the traded deforestaion considerably more critical. 
								One culture's way of life should not limit another culture's way of life - offsetting the tropical forest loss with temperate
								forest does unfortunately not bring balance.
